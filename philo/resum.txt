Sure! Here's a script that describes how the project works and how each function contributes to its functionality:

Script: Understanding the Dining Philosophers Problem Implementation

Introduction:
The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization problem often used to illustrate the challenges of deadlock and resource allocation in concurrent programming. 
In this implementation, we have a certain number of philosophers sitting around a table, 
each thinking and eating. 
However, there are only a limited number of forks available for them to eat, 
and they must share them without causing deadlock or starvation.

1. Initialization:

The main function initializes the dining information and starts the simulation.
initialize_info parses command-line arguments and initializes the dining configuration.
initialize_philosophers creates philosopher threads and initializes their attributes.
initialize_mutex initializes the mutexes used for synchronization.
2. Philosopher Threads:

philosopher_thread_start represents the behavior of each philosopher thread.
Philosophers alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping.
If a philosopher's time limit without eating is exceeded, they die, 
and the simulation might terminate.
3. Eating and Deadlock Prevention:

Philosophers attempt to acquire both their left and right forks before eating to prevent deadlock.
The eat function simulates a philosopher picking up forks and eating.
check_death ensures that philosophers die if they exceed their time limit without eating, 
preventing starvation.
4. Completion and Output:

check_completion checks if the simulation has completed.
The report_status function prints the current status of philosophers and the completion of the simulation.
5. Resource Management and Cleanup:

free_info and free_and_destroy functions handle memory deallocation and mutex destruction.
destroy_resources ensures proper cleanup after the simulation finishes.
Conclusion:
This project effectively demonstrates the Dining Philosophers Problem, 
showing how to manage shared resources and synchronize concurrent processes to avoid deadlocks and starvation.

End of Script

This script provides an overview of the project's structure, the purpose of each function,
and how they contribute to solving the Dining Philosophers Problem. 
Let me know if you need further clarification on any part!


This program simulates the dining behavior of philosophers using multithreading and mutexes. It consists of several key components:

Structures: The program defines two main structures, t_philosopher representing individual philosophers and t_dining_info representing dining information for the simulation.

Initialization: The main function initializes the dining information based on command-line arguments, creates philosophers, and initializes mutexes for synchronization.

Philosopher Lifecycle: Each philosopher is represented by a thread executing the philosopher_thread_start function. This function manages the lifecycle of each philosopher, including eating, sleeping, and thinking in an infinite loop.

Resource Management: The program uses mutexes to manage access to shared resources such as forks and meal-related data. This ensures that only one philosopher can access a fork at a time and that meal-related data is updated safely.

Completion Check: The program checks for two conditions to complete the simulation: either a philosopher dies or all philosophers have eaten the required number of meals. Once either condition is met, the simulation terminates.

Error Handling: The program includes error handling for invalid input and resource allocation failures. Error messages are printed to stderr, and appropriate error codes are returned.

Overall, this program demonstrates concurrent programming concepts such as thread synchronization and resource management to simulate a classic dining philosophers problem.
